## Code to process manual splitting

This code is only inculded for completeness' sake. It uses the `Split times per file.xlsx` file and the skipped files from the automated fitting to prepare for another automated run of the fitting. All the data required to run these scripts is not included.

This code was manually run to ensure that all the skipped files were appropriately split.
