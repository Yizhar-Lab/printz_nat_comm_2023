# printz_natcom_code
This folder has the code used to perform the analysis. Since many parts of the analysis were run on cluster, not all code is ready to run, but can be easily modified so that it can be. Full raw data required to run the deconvolution and the fitting is not included, but example files are.


Each folder has the instructions to set up the python environment to run the scripts in that folder.
